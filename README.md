This is a project to learn and demonstrate Reinforcement Learning on a simple game like Snake 
The project contains the following:
  1. A long Train and a short Train :Pytorch model with 11 input layers , 256 hidden layers and 3 output layers ,. 11 input includes boundary danger values,
     Placement of food , current direction and rewards . The 3 output is for direction ( Continue strainght , Turn right , Turn left )
  2. The game is a simple Pygame game recreation of Snake
  3. The goal is for the following :
       1. Learn basics of Reinforcement Learning
       2. Perform good Documentation Processes / Learn how to do so
